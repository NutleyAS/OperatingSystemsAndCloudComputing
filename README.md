# OperatingSystemsAndCloudComputing

## Project Brief

For the project I was required to create a WordPress website. The website had to be hosted on a AWS cloud-based LAMP server which I built as part of the module Labs. The website was based on the WearOS which is the Google operating system for smart watches and wearables. 

## Submission

The 'aronNutley.wpress' file contains the submitted website for the project. The LAMP server which hosted the website is no longer running so the backup has to be viewed locally.
